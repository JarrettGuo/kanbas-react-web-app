# Kanbas Project

## Overview

I've taken my first steps into web development by bootstrapping this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In my project directory, I have the following commands at my disposal:

- `npm start`: This fires up the app in development mode. I can view it in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It's pretty handy since the page reloads automatically if I edit anything, and it also shows me lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`: This one launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. For more info, I can check out the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

- `npm run build`: When I'm ready to go live, this builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashesâ€”everything I need to deploy my app.

- `npm run eject`: **Important: this is irreversible.** Once I `eject`, there's no going back! If I decide I'm not happy with the build tool and configuration choices, I can `eject` any time. This removes the single build dependency from my project and copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into my project, so I have full control over them.

> A quick note: I don't need to use `eject`. It's there for when I'm ready to take full control, but the preset configuration is suitable for small and middle deployments, and I'm not obligated to use it.

## CSS and Bootstrap Styling

I've revisited the Kanbas screens from the previous assignment where I left the documents in their natural, unstyled state. This time around, I've spiced things up with CSS and Bootstrap to layout and color the screens, so they align more with the provided screenshots.

I've put in the effort to style the HTML to make the screens look as close as possible to the intended design. While they don't need to be a pixel-perfect match, I've followed provided guidelines and requirements for a consistent and appealing look and feel.

## Further Learning

To learn more about how to use Create React App, I've been reading through the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

And for a deeper dive into React, I'm exploring the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
